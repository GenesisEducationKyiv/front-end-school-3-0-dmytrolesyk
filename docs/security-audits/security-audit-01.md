# Proposal to replace @tanstack/react-form with react-hook-form

Although [Socket.dev report on @tanstack/react-form](https://socket.dev/npm/package/@tanstack/react-form) gives 100 score on Supply Chain Security and 100 score on Vulnerability, it also highlights that this package's dependencies have 9 high alerts with Supply Chain Risks.

At the same time [report on react-hook-form](https://socket.dev/npm/package/react-hook-form) indicates only 1 medium alert of such kind. Also Quality score is higher for `react-hook-form`.

The number of weekly downloads is also much higher for `react-hook-form`.
